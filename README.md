# browser-anonimity-comparison
This project is part of a master's thesis comparing the behavior of the Tor Browser and standard web browsers in terms of security, privacy, and anonymity. It uses automated Selenium experiments to analyze browser fingerprints, exposed data, and network traffic, aiming to identify privacy leaks and assess the level of anonymity of each browser.
